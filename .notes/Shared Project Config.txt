description of shared projects

ShExStorageC
* shared code used to create and process schemas - app specific
* expectation: to ge copied, as is, from project to project
* contains revit specific code
* contains app specific code
* schema field stuff goes here:
	> ShSchemaFields
* schema data stuff goes here:
	> ShSchemaData
* ex storage stuff goes here
	> ShExStorage


ShExStorageN
* shared code used to process schemas - not revit specific
* expectation: to be copied, as is, from project to project
* must be kept non-revit specific - this allows the creation of non-revit / window apps for testing
* must be kept non-app specific
* schema field stuff goes here:
	> ShSchemaFields
* schema data stuff goes here:
	> ShSchemaData
* ex storage stuff goes here
	> ShExStorage


ShExStorageR
* shared code used to process schemas - with revit specific
* expectation: to be copied, as is, from project to project
* contains revit specific code
* must be kept non-app specific
* schema field stuff goes here:
	> ShSchemaFields
* schema data stuff goes here:
	> ShSchemaData
* ex storage stuff goes here
	> ShExStorage


ShStudy
* shared code for debugging code
* expectation: everything gets eliminated in a release project
* must be kept non-revit specific
* must be kept non-app specific
