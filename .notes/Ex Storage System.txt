notes:

keep in mind:

* user can have multiple revit files open at the same time
* revit schema's are all kept in a joint memory area
* unless a mistake, a user can only have a revit file open once -- but it, as a mistake, they could open more than once.
* a revit file can be opened by more than one user on different machines
* the ex storage information could be access by two users at the same time - unlikely but possible

Exid has the unique schema name preface.
{vendor id}_{DB title (cleaned)}

two schema levels + locks



Application method
Per Revit Database

^ (1) table data stores
	> named:
		pro.cyberstudio_{revit DB title (cleaned)}_table
	> holds multiple rows as sub-schema
	> identifies basic information
		* description, version, model name, model path, developer, creation date
	* holds basic management information
	* needs to hold a list of found rows
	* must have a unique name but one that can be re-created from just opening the database


^ each row (is a sub-schema to table)
	> named:
		pro.cyberstudio_{revit DB title (cleaned) }_rows.family
	> holds data for a single row
		* basic information and
		* excel path, worksheet, row family, sequence, etc.
	> will also hold the data for each row family instance
	* this will be a sub-schema of the table schema
	* holds the information for a specific excel worksheet & family
	* is the starting point to read / process all of the associated family
	* needs to have a list of all of the associated family


^ each cell family instance (is a sub-dictionary [but not schema] to row)
	> holds information associated to each cell family instance
