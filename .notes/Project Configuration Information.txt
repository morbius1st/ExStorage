$ProjectName$ is the primary project

App2 is a second project just to help set up shared resources
	references <SharedCode> 
	uses "shared" sample data
	uses other shared elements

-- best practices --
* when a shared RESX file (and its associated CS file) are linked into a project, edit the .csproj file to make the proper dependancy setting.
		that is, add the <DependantUpon> tag and reference the resx file.

-- notes -- 
* most of the information provided is for illustration purposes and can be replaced.
* don't change folder names (for shared information) unless the revision is carried throughout all of the related files (CS files, XAML files, and .csproj files)
	changing names can cause things to break.
* sometimes, thinks do not go as expected.  VS can get confused.  Best to un-load a project and re-load or un-load the solution and re-load.

-- expections / intent --
each project
* can have local resource file(s) [strings (resx) / images]  (CS files and XAML files)
* can use shared resource file(s) [strings (resx) / images]  (CS files and XAML files)
* can use shared code files
* can use shared WPF files
* configured to use designtime sample data 

The above are referenced / directly used and are not used from a satellite assembly.



-- other "shared" projects --
Sh{name}	shared CS code files that several apps may use - e.g. ShExStorage
	This is a sub-set of the SharedApp project
	This has code files from SharedApp LINKED into this project
	May have shared code group specific code files

-- shared project system --
SharedCode (shared project) 
	has some or all of the CS code files from SharedApp
	this gets referenced into a project
	there can be multiple versions of this project that different sub-sets of the CS code files
		this can help with prevention of duplicate names and / or overriding of code when a local
		code file gets made that uses the same namespace (primarly for testing)
SharedApp (WPF project - not a shared project - needed as custon tool will not run otherwise)
	Xaml code files
	Xaml image files (SVG)
	Associated CS code files
		Code behind file
		Attached properties
		Value converters
	Resource files (Images)
	Resource files (string resx)

-- shared WPF windows / dialogs (examples) --
ShSplashWin		Shared window
ShDialogEx		Shared Example Dialog Window(s)


create (link shared information only into App2 as that is only a example project)
App2 project (Wpf project [not a library])
Sh{name}		project (shared project) (e.g. ShDialogEx)
SharedCode		project (shared project)
SharedApp		project (WPF project)
